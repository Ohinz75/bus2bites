# Problem Statement

Few apps focus on bus commuters as an end user. Mapping apps and restaurant apps often include quick ways to see commuting directions, but bus commuters don't have a single, convenient solution for discovering restaurants along their routes. This is where Bus2Bites comes in! All restaurant suggestions are centered around the most convenient food spots on a given bus route!

# Use Benefits

- Convenience: Pick up dinner at a restaurant along your route home
- Accessibility: All restaurant results are within 100 meters of a bus stop on a given route, reducing the walk time to a little over 1 min
- Discovery: Learn about new restaurants within a convenient proximity to the bus
